# What is Algorithms?

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules used to solve problems or perform specific tasks. They are fundamental to computer science and programming, as they provide a systematic approach to problem-solving.

- Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, such as pseudocode or flowcharts, and can be implemented in different programming languages.
- They are essential for designing efficient and optimized solutions, enabling computers to process and manipulate data effectively.
- Understanding algorithms is crucial for developers to write efficient code and create innovative software solutions.
