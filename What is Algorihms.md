# What is Algorithms?

An algorithms is kind of a process to make a food.

## Example

Suppose you are making a tasty dish of noodles. What would you do?

- Collect the ingredients
- Process the ingredients to make the dis
- Serve the dish to the consumer

in the same way algorithm works.

Suppose you're gonna make an algorithm to sum two numbers. How would it be done?

- Send input (same as Collect the ingredients)
- Make the sum of the inputs (same as Process the ingredients to make the dis)
- Get the output (same as Serve the dish to the consumer)
